The game included in the project was prepared for the Introduction to Game Development course I took at Yıldız Technical University. 

-The game includes 3 different weapons, 3 different enemies, and 3 different character abilities. 

-The character has a health system, level, and experience system. 

-The Unity pool system is used, and each object created repeatedly is taken from the pool if it is there, and if it is not in the pool and is needed, it is instantiated and added to the pool. These are poolable objects such as enemies, portals, experience particles, and bullets. 

-In addition, the character's weapon switching and the different ways each weapon is held are prepared with the animation rigging system.
